## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── static
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .node-version
    ├── .prettierignore
    ├── README.md
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── package.json
    └── yarn.lock

  1.  **`/node_modules`**: The directory where all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.  
  
  2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser), like your site header, or a page template. “Src” is a convention for “source code”.

  3.  **`/static`**: This directory will contain all of the static assets that are copied over to the final build folder.
  
  4.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

  5.  **`.node-version`**: This file tells you and the deployment service which version of Node we prefer be used when developing, building, and deploying this site.
  
  6.  **`.prettierignore`**: This is a configuration file for a tool called [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), which is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent. This file specifically tells Prettier which files to ignore while formatting.
  
  7.  **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

  8.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).
  
  9.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.
  
  10.  **`yarn.lock`**: [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is a package manager alternative to npm. You can use either yarn or npm, though all of the Gatsby docs reference npm.  This file serves essentially the same purpose as `package-lock.json`, just for a different package management system.
